# udagram-serverless-go

This project is part of my Capstone Project for [Udacity's Cloud Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990).

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree.
It allows users to register and log into a web client and post photos to the feed.

This is a brand new Serverless version of the API using Go.

The project is split into two parts:
1. [The Frontend](https://github.com/leandrorondon/udagram-frontend): A basic Ionic client web application, bootstrapped from [Udacity Simple Frontend](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-frontend).
2. This Serverless API.

## Serverless framework

```
# npm install -g serverless@2.72.2
# serverless plugin install -n serverless-iam-roles-per-function
# serverless plugin install -n serverless-plugin-tracing"

```
